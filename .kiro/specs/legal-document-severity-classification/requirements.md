# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a sophisticated severity classification system for legal documents using a bucketed context mechanism. The system will organize reference documents into semantic buckets, then use the most relevant bucket at inference time to guide severity tagging of incoming documents. The system integrates with Firestore for document storage and uses the latest Gemini model for AI-powered classification.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Document Storage and Management

**User Story:** As a legal analyst, I want to store and manage reference documents in a structured way, so that the system can learn from historical precedents and policies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a reference document is uploaded THEN the system SHALL store it in Firestore with metadata including document type, creation date, and severity label
2. WHEN storing reference documents THEN the system SHALL generate embeddings using Gemini's embedding model
3. IF a document already exists with the same content hash THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate storage
4. WHEN retrieving reference documents THEN the system SHALL return documents with their associated metadata and embeddings

### Requirement 2: Semantic Bucket Creation and Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reference documents to be automatically organized into semantic buckets, so that similar legal domains are grouped together for efficient retrieval.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reference documents are processed THEN the system SHALL cluster them into semantic buckets using embedding similarity
2. WHEN creating buckets THEN each bucket SHALL store a unique ID, descriptive name, centroid embedding, and list of contained documents
3. WHEN new reference documents are added THEN the system SHALL recompute bucket centroids to maintain accuracy
4. IF bucket semantic drift is detected THEN the system SHALL support bucket merging or splitting operations
5. WHEN buckets are created THEN each SHALL contain metadata: bucket_id (UUID), bucket_name (string), centroid_embedding (vector), and documents array

### Requirement 3: Document Classification Pipeline

**User Story:** As a legal analyst, I want to classify incoming documents for severity, so that I can prioritize review and response based on risk level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new document is submitted for classification THEN the system SHALL embed the document using Gemini's embedding model
2. WHEN selecting relevant context THEN the system SHALL compare the document embedding against bucket centroids and select top-K most similar buckets
3. WHEN retrieving context THEN the system SHALL fetch top-N most similar document chunks from selected buckets
4. WHEN classifying THEN the system SHALL use Gemini model with structured prompt template to return severity classification
5. WHEN returning results THEN the system SHALL provide JSON output with label, confidence, rationale, and evidence_ids

### Requirement 4: Rule Engine and Override System

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want to define deterministic rules that can override AI classifications, so that critical legal requirements are never missed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deterministic rules are defined THEN the system SHALL store them with conditions and severity mappings
2. WHEN processing a document THEN the system SHALL check all applicable rules before finalizing classification
3. IF a rule condition is met THEN the system SHALL override the AI classification with the rule-specified severity
4. WHEN rules conflict THEN the system SHALL apply the rule with highest priority or most restrictive severity
5. WHEN rule overrides occur THEN the system SHALL log the override reason and rule ID in the output

### Requirement 5: Automated Classification Processing

**User Story:** As a legal team manager, I want all documents to be automatically classified without manual intervention, so that the system provides immediate results for all submissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN classification is completed THEN the system SHALL automatically accept all classifications regardless of confidence level
2. WHEN classification confidence is low THEN the system SHALL include confidence warnings in the response but still provide the classification
3. WHEN calculating final confidence THEN the system SHALL combine model confidence, chunk similarity, and rule override weights
4. WHEN classifications are made THEN the system SHALL log the classification details and confidence scores for audit purposes
5. WHEN low confidence classifications occur THEN the system SHALL flag them in the response for potential manual review if desired

### Requirement 6: Classification Audit and Logging

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging of all classification decisions, so that the system maintains full audit trails and transparency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN classifications are made THEN the system SHALL log all evidence chunks grouped by bucket used in the decision
2. WHEN classifications are completed THEN the system SHALL store complete audit information including input, context, and reasoning
3. WHEN audit logs are created THEN the system SHALL include timestamps, confidence scores, and rule applications
4. WHEN classification results are stored THEN the system SHALL maintain immutable records for compliance purposes
5. WHEN audit trails are accessed THEN the system SHALL provide complete traceability from input to final classification

### Requirement 7: Performance Monitoring and Evaluation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor classification performance metrics, so that I can ensure the system maintains high accuracy over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN classifications are made THEN the system SHALL track classification distribution and confidence metrics per severity class
2. WHEN buckets are selected THEN the system SHALL monitor bucket selection patterns and usage statistics
3. WHEN confidence scores are assigned THEN the system SHALL track calibration metrics including confidence distribution analysis
4. WHEN evaluations are performed THEN the system SHALL generate performance reports and confidence assessment metrics
5. WHEN audit logs are created THEN the system SHALL record input document, chosen bucket, retrieved evidence, and final decision for analysis

### Requirement 8: API Integration and Response Format

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean API interface for document classification, so that I can integrate the severity system with other applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL accept documents via REST endpoints
2. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL return standardized JSON responses with required fields including confidence warnings for low-confidence results
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
4. WHEN responses are generated THEN they SHALL include label, confidence, rationale, evidence_ids, bucket_id, and confidence_warning flags
5. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL support both single document and batch processing modes with immediate results

### Requirement 9: Firestore Integration and Data Persistence

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want all document data and classifications stored in Firestore, so that the system is scalable and maintains data consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are stored THEN the system SHALL use Firestore collections for reference documents, buckets, and classifications
2. WHEN querying data THEN the system SHALL efficiently retrieve documents using Firestore indexes
3. WHEN embeddings are stored THEN the system SHALL handle vector data serialization and deserialization
4. WHEN concurrent access occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency using Firestore transactions
5. WHEN data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling for network and database failures

### Requirement 10: Gemini Model Integration

**User Story:** As a technical lead, I want to use the latest Gemini model for both embeddings and classification, so that the system leverages state-of-the-art AI capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating embeddings THEN the system SHALL use Gemini's embedding model for consistent vector representations
2. WHEN classifying documents THEN the system SHALL use Gemini's latest language model with structured prompts
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting and retry logic for Gemini API
4. WHEN responses are processed THEN the system SHALL parse and validate JSON outputs from Gemini
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement fallback strategies and proper error logging for Gemini API failures
